# Changelog

The version prints at startup (`[rsmc] vX.Y.Z loaded`), so a test result can always be tied to an
exact build.

`VERSIONS.txt` is the short form of this file — one or two lines per version. Both are maintained;
this one carries the reasoning, that one is the index.

## 0.1.0

**Project set up, and the design question answered before any of it was built.**

Issue #13 on rstweaks proposed a multiblock crafter and was honest that it might be too big: a
multiblock means blocks, block entities, models, a validation system, a GUI and network sync, and
rstweaks registers no content at all. It also asked the right question — *is the goal throughput,
or fewer blocks placed?* — and noted that if it is throughput, the cheaper answer might be
improving how tasks spread across existing autocrafters.

Reading RS's autocrafting settled it. `StepBehavior` is a two-method `@API STABLE` interface that
`PatternProvider` extends, and it is RS's *entire* throughput model:

| autocrafter | steps per action | tick gate | steps/tick |
|---|---|---|---|
| no upgrades | 1 | every 10 | 0.10 |
| 4 speed upgrades | 5 | every 2 | 2.50 |

So the ceiling on stock RS crafting speed is 2.5 steps/tick, and the whole speed-upgrade ladder is
two numbers a pattern provider reports about itself. A multiblock crafter therefore needs **no task
engine, no scheduler and no mixins** — it needs to be a network node that answers those two methods
with numbers derived from the structure's size. Planning, task execution and the autocrafting
monitor all stay RS's, untouched. That is also what makes this a separate mod rather than an
rstweaks feature: rstweaks is a pure mixin mod, and this one is blocks.

**The shape rule: a solid rectangular box, 1 to 16 per axis.** Built from CPU blocks (speed, four
tiers) and pattern storage blocks (capacity, one tier), mixed freely.

Solid box rather than any connected blob, because a shape rule has to answer two questions a
player will ask — did my structure form, and which block is wrong — and an arbitrary blob answers
neither. There is no such thing as a missing block in a shape with no expected form. A filled box
gives every failure a coordinate.

The consequence is deliberate and is pinned as a test so nobody quietly "fixes" it: **two boxes
placed flush against each other are one connected region, that region is not a box, and both stop
working.** Leave a gap.

**Speed is a plain sum**, in steps per tick: 1K = 1, 4K = 4, 16K = 16, 64K = 64 per block. Named
and weighted after RS's storage blocks because the blocks are retextured RS storage blocks — a
player already reads that ladder. A sum rather than anything cleverer so that counting blocks tells
you the answer and adding a block is never a downgrade. One 1K CPU is 1 step/tick: ten times a bare
autocrafter, still under a maxed one, which is where the smallest structure should sit.

**Detection is free of Minecraft types.** The level is reached through a one-method `BlockSource`,
so the whole of it runs in a plain JVM under `./gradlew shapeCheck` — 25 cases, wired into `build`.
This is rstweaks' `plannerCheck` pattern adopted from the start rather than after the fact: the
awkward cases here (the hole, the overhang, the flush neighbour, the 17-long box) are exactly the
ones that get checked once by hand in game and then never again.

Not built yet: blocks, block entities, models, textures, the network node, the pattern GUI,
recipes.
